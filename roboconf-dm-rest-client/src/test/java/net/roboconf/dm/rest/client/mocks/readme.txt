Although we could have used a mocking framework (like Mockito), we preferred
implement hard-coded mocks. Thus, they serve as an example for implementing the
REST API. They also provide an implementation which is very similar to what the
Deployment Manager will have to use.

DO NOT delete or replace them!
Mockito (or an equivalent solution) will be used, as an example,
to test web applications and mock the REST services.
