Roboconf is a solution for asynchronous and multi-target deployments.  
It allows to deploy distributed applications over several machines (VM, connected objects, IoT) or
groups of machines (multi-IaaS, hybrid cloud). Transposing the concepts of component models like OSGi,
Roboconf can install and also reconfigure dynamically a topology of applications.

Roboconf is not a concurrent of solutions like Puppet or Chef.  
In fact, it can use these solutions, by delegating them some tasks. For the moment,
only Puppet and bash plug-ins are available.

The project is still incubating, but we hope to have a stable version soon.  
More information is available at [roboconf.net](http://roboconf.github.io/en/index.html).
