This repository contains the source code for the Roboconf platform.  
This includes the manager, the agent, their default distributions, the tooling core and the Maven plugin.

Roboconf is a solution for asynchronous and multi-target deployments.  
It allows to deploy distributed applications over several machines (VM, connected objects, IoT) or
groups of machines (public clouds, hybrid clouds...). Transposing the concepts of component models like OSGi,
Roboconf can install and also reconfigure dynamically a topology of applications.

More information and tutorials are available on the [website](http://roboconf.net).
