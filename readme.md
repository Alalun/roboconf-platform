This repository contains the source code for the Roboconf platform.  
This includes the **Deployment Manager**, the **Agents** and their default distributions.

Roboconf is a solution for asynchronous and multi-target deployments.  
It allows to deploy distributed applications over several machines (VM, connected objects, IoT) or
groups of machines (multi-IaaS, hybrid cloud). Transposing the concepts of component models like OSGi,
Roboconf can install and also reconfigure dynamically a topology of applications.

Roboconf brings asynchronous configuration to solutions like Bash, Puppet or Chef.  
For the moment, only Puppet and bash plugins are available.
